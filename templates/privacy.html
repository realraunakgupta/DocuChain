                    early-stage beta project. We are not yet a registered corporate entity. The following principles
                    guide our data practices but do not constitute a legally binding agreement at this time.
                </div>

                <h4 class="fw-bold mt-4 mb-3">1. Data Minimization</h4>
                <p class="text-muted">DocuChain is designed to operate on a zero-knowledge basis for document contents.
                    We do not store, view, or process the actual contents of your sensitive documents. We only generate
                    and store cryptographic hashes (SHA-256) of your files.</p>

                <h4 class="fw-bold mt-4 mb-3">2. Public Ledger</h4>
                <p class="text-muted">When a document is anchored to the DocuChain ledger, its cryptographic hash and
                    associated metadata (Issuer Name, Holder Name, Credential ID) become part of a permanent, immutable
                    public record necessary for verification. This data cannot be deleted or forged.</p>

                <h4 class="fw-bold mt-4 mb-3">3. Personal Information</h4>
                <p class="text-muted">We collect minimal personal information such as names and optionally, a profile
                    picture (which is securely stored on our servers and uniquely referenced by its hash). We will never
                    sell, lease, or distribute your email or personal information to third parties.</p>

                <h4 class="fw-bold mt-4 mb-3">4. Security Practices</h4>
                <p class="text-muted">We use industry-standard security measures, including bcrypt for password hashing
                    and secure session tokens, to protect user accounts.</p>
